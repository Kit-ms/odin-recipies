Odin recipe repo

First odin project using purely html to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page with links to other recipes. Currently the website is just html based to practice these skills but will be revisited in the future to employ CSS to improve the overall design of the website to make it look more visaully pleasing.
