    <h4> Easy Egg Fried Rice recipe which nicely uses up leftover rice from the night before.
        This dish is ready before you know it and is an excellent lunchtime meal or side dish for that 
        Friday night bonanza. </h4>
    <h3>Ingredients list</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 tbsp vegetable oil </li>
        <li> 2 eggs </li>
        <li> 2 spring onions </li>
        <li> 250g day old rice </li>
        <li> 100g frozen mixed vegetables </li>
        <li> 1 block frozen ginger paste </li>
        <li> 1 block frozen garlic paste </li>
        <li> Light & dark soy sauce </li>
        <li> 1 tbsp Gouchujang </li>
        <li> 1 tsp Seasame Oil </li>
        <li> 1 tsp MSG </li>
        <li> Siracha to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok and add eggs. Scramble until golden. </li>
        <li> Whilst the eggs scramble, chop the spring onion and add the white part to the egg once ready
            and cook for 1 min. </li> 
        <li>Add in the day old rice and frozen vegetables at this point alongside the frozen garlic and ginger 
            paste and cook through for 4 mins. (We use day old rice so that the rice doesn't break
            apart and gives a much nicer texture when completed.) </li>
        <li>Then add the Gouchujang, light soy sauce and teaspoon of MSG, mixing together as
            each ingredient is added. Then add the seasame oil and allow to cook for 2 mins. </li>
        <li>Add Siricha to taste and garnish with the green parts of the spring onion and some
            seasame seeds if you have them. </li> 
    </ol>
